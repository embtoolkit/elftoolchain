Release Notes for Elftoolchain Software Version 0.6.1
=====================================================

About The Project
-----------------

The `Elftoolchain project`_ develops BSD-licensed implementations of
essential compilation tools and libraries for handling ELF based program
objects.

About The Release
-----------------

This is the first release on the v0.6 "stable" code line.

Since our prior v0.5.1 release, we have added support for building the
project on additional operating systems, namely DragonFlyBSD, Minix
and OpenBSD.  A number of bugs were fixed, and the project's
documentation has been improved.

No new utilities are being introduced in this release.
