Release Information
===================

Changes in this release
-----------------------

This is the first public release of the Elftoolchain sources.

Differences with prior FreeBSD versions of some components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some of the libraries and utilities in this release were originally
developed at the FreeBSD_ project.  These components differ from their
prior versions in FreeBSD source tree in the following ways:

:ar:
    - ``ar`` supports BSD-style archives.
:brandelf:
    - ``brandelf`` supports additional ELF brands.
:libdwarf:
    - The ``libdwarf`` library implements the complete DWARF(3)
      producer and consumer API set.  Each public API has been
      documented in the form of a manual page.
:libelf:
    - ``libelf`` supports operations on special devices in addition to
      regular files.
    - ``libelf`` supports opening of ELF objects in read/write mode.
    - The archive handling APIs in ``libelf`` can process BSD-style archives.
    - Numerous bugs in the code have been fixed.

Additionally, the manual pages associated with these components have
been improved.

Outstanding Issues
------------------

There were no outstanding issues at the time of the release.

Known Limitations
-----------------

This release has the following limitations:

:Test coverage: Our test suites are still under development and the
    test coverage for this release is partial.

:Performance and Memory Use: Our tools have not been characterized for
    their memory usage or for their performance characteristics.

We hope to address these limitations in future releases.
