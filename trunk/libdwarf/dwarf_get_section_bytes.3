.Dt DWARF_GET_SECTION_BYTES 3
.Sh NAME
.Nm dwarf_get_section_bytes
.Nd retrieve ELF section byte streams
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libdwarf
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libdwarf.h
.Ft Dwarf_Ptr
.Fo dwarf_get_section_bytes
.Fa "Dwarf_P_Debug dbg"
.Fa "Dwarf_Signed dwarf_section"
.Fa "Dwarf_Signed *elf_section_index"
.Fa "Dwarf_Unsigned *length"
.Fa "Dwarf_Error *err"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_bytes
returns the ELF section byte streams generated.
Each call of this function will return the byte stream for one ELF
section.
This function should be called after the application code have called
.Xr dwarf_transform_to_disk_form 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dbg
should reference a DWARF producer instance allocated using
.Xr dwarf_producer_init 3
or
.Xr dwarf_producer_init_b 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dwarf_section
should specify the 0-based section number of the desired ELF
section.
The total number of sections generated is returned by
.Xr dwarf_transform_to_disk_form 3 .
.Pp
Argument
.Ar dwarf_section
is actually ignored by the library.
The first call to this function will always return the first ELF
section, and the subsequent calls will return the rest of sections
in the order when they were generated, until the last one.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar elf_section_index
should point to a location which will be set to the section index value
of the returned ELF section.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar length
should point to a location which will hold the length in bytes of the
returned ELF section.
.Pp
If argument
.Ar err
is not NULL, it will be used to store error information in case
of an error.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On success, function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_bytes
returns a pointer to a ELF section byte stream.
In case of an error, function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_bytes
return NULL and set the argument
.Ar err .
.Ss Memory Management
The memory area used for ELF section byte streams should be freed using the
function
.Fn dwarf_producer_finish .
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn dwarf_get_section_bytes
can fail with:
.Bl -tag -width ".Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY"
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_ARGUMENT
Argument
.Ar dbg ,
.Ar elf_section_index ,
or
.Ar length
was NULL.
.It Bq Er DW_DLE_NO_ENTRY
There was no more ELF sections to retrieve or
.Xr dwarf_transform_to_disk_form 3
was not called before.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To generate ELF section byte streams and retrieve them, use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Dwarf_P_Debug dbg;
Dwarf_Signed count, i, sec_index;
Dwarf_Unsigned len;
Dwarf_Ptr bytes;
Dwarf_Error de;

/* ... assume dbg refers to a DWARF producer instance ... */

/*
 * application code add various DWARF debugging information
 * to the producer instance...
 */

if ((count = dwarf_transform_to_disk_form(dbg, &de)) ==
    DW_DLV_NOCOUNT) {
	warnx("dwarf_transform_to_disk_form failed: %s",
	    dwarf_errmsg(-1));
	return;
}

for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	bytes = dwarf_get_section_bytes(dbg, i, &sec_index, &len,
	    &de);
	if (bytes == NULL) {
		warnx("dwarf_get_section_bytes failed: %s",
		    dwarf_errmsg(-1));
		continue;
	}
	/* ... use the returned byte stream ... */
}

dwarf_producer_finish(dbg, &de);
