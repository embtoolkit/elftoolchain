.Sh NAME
.Nm strings
.Nd "print the strings of printable characters in files"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl afho
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar radix
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Fo each
.Ar file
given, the
.Nm
utility prints any contiguous seqeunce of printable
characters of atleast 'n' characters long (the default is 4 characters)
followed by an unprintable character.
.Nm
only scans the initialized and loaded sections of ELF objects; for other
file types, the entire file is scanned.
The
.Nm
utility is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text files.
.Pp
If no file name is specified in the input, standard input is read from.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl a
This option instructs
.Nm
to scan the entire file. This is useful to override the default behaviour of
scanning only initialized and loaded section of ELF objects.
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Select the character encoding to be used while searching for strings.
The encoding depends on the single character argument which speicifes
the encoding;
.Ar s
for single 7-bit-byte characters (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc., default).
.Ar S
for single 8-bit-byte characters.
.Ar l
for 16-bit littleendian.
.Ar b
for 16-bit bigendian.
.Ar L
for 32-bit littleendian.
.Ar B
for 32-bit bigendian.
.It Fl f
Print the name of the file before each string.
.It Fl t Ar radix
Print the offset from the start of the file before each string. The
format depends on the single character argument which specifies the
radix of the offset;
.Ar d
for decimal,
.Ar o
for octal,
.Ar x
for hexadecimal.
.It Fl n Ar number
Print the contiguous character sequence of alteast
.Ar number
characters long, instead of default 4 characters.
.It Fl o
This is same as -t o.
.It Fl h
This prints a usage summary and exits.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following are examples of typical usage
of the
.Nm
command:
.Dl ""
.Dl "$ strings /bin/ls"
.Dl "$ strings -a /bin/ln"
.Dl "$ strings -a -f -t x /bin/cat"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ar 1 ,
.Xr nm 1 ,
.Xr objdump 1 ,
.Xr ranlib ,
.Xr readelf 1
.Sh HISTORY
The first FreeBSD
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Fx v3.
It was later discontinued in
.Fx v5 ,
when i386-only a.out format was dropped in favor of ELF.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
utility was re-written by
.An S.Sam Arun Raj Aq samarunraj@gmail.com

.Sh LIMITATIONS
Unlike the GNU
.Nm
this doesn't support multiple object file formats, only ELF using the
.Xr elf 3
and
.Xr gelf 3
API's.
