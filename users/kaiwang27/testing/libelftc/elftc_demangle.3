.In libelf.h
.Ft int
.Fn elftc_demangle "const char *mangledname" "char *buffer" "size_t bufsize" "unsigned int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Function
.Fn elftc_demangle
decodes a symbol name encoded according to the type encoding rules
for the C++ language and returns a string denoting an equivalent
C++ prototype.
.Pp
Argument
.Ar mangledname
specifies the encoded symbol name.
Argument
.Ar buffer
denotes a programmer-specified area to place the prototype string in.
Argument
.Ar bufsize
specifies the size of the programmer-specified area.
Argument
.Ar flags
specifies the mangling style and the flags that control demangle behaviour.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Function
.Fn elftc_demangle
returns 0 on success.
In case of an error it returns -1 and sets
the ELF error number.
.Sh ERRORS
Function
.Fn elftc_demangle
may fail with the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width "[ELF_E_RESOURCE]"
.It Bq Er EINVAL
Argument
.Ar mangled_name
was not a valid mangled name.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The output buffer specified by arguments
.Ar buffer
and
.Ar bufsize
are too small to hold the demangled name.
